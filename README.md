# YOOBIC London Dev Hiring Project
## The ask
Hi, thanks your interest in YOOBIC and for agreeing to take on this small project. This will help us get to know you and your skills a bit better, and will hopefully be more fun and more useful than coding on a whiteboard.

We want you to build a a small demo app in [ionic2](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/tree/2.0). We're using ionic2 internally at Yoobic to build a version of our mobile app for legacy devices, and a lot of the work in this role is going to be about building ionic2 app components.

We understand that this is probably a brand new framework to you; you're probably going to need to take some of the time to learn it. That's actually entirely the point. The JavaScript world is constantly evolving and here at YOOBIC we put a lot of our efforts into evolving along with it. We're constantly learning and we want to see that you can too. In fact if you already have experience building projects in Ionic2 or Angular2 let us know! We'd love to take a look and we'll talk about what we'd like you to do instead.

*A final note*: Ionic2 is still in beta currently and it has some bugs and kinks to be worked out. This means your app likely will too. If that's the case, it's fine. We're going to be looking more at how you built it than at what you built. Moreover, if you can't make it work, or you're struggling to finish in a reasonable amount of time, again: don't sweat it. We want to see what you've learned; if you don't have time to build all of it, then feel free sketch out the missing pieces and tell us how you'd build them and wire it all together. 

## The big picture
(We want you to build this)

## The spec
Actually we want you to build is what you see above with a slight change. Instead of building the CHAT view as you see above, we want a DETAIL view that show you the details of one of the items from the MASTER LIST. Here the items are presented as missions, but they don't have to be in your app. You can make them Heroes *รก la* the [Angular2 Quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) or use the [Star Wars API](http://www.swapi.com) to present Star Wars characters, or really anything you want. Have fun with it, but keep in mind that we're really interested in how you build the guts of the app, moreso than the views and UX elements themselves. Feel free to use minimal or boiler-plate designs, or if you're really keen you can try to replicate ours (see [Designs](#Designs) below).

#### Spec(ifically)
###### Views
 + Sign-in
 + Menu
 + Master List
 + Detail view



>**Bonus 1)**
>If you find yourself with extra time on your hands and are having fun, go ahead and add a chat view, or other interesting views. The views aren't the key component
