# Yoobic London Dev Hiring Project
## The ask
Hi, thanks your interest in Yoobic and for agreeing to take on this small project. This will help us get to know you and your skills a bit better, and will hopefully be more fun and more useful than coding on a whiteboard.

We want you to build a a small demo app in [ionic2](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/tree/2.0). We're using ionic2 internally at Yoobic to build a version of our mobile app for legacy devices. Ionic2 is still in beta currently and it has some bugs and kinks to be worked out. This means your app likely will too. If that's the case don't sweat it, it's fine. We're going to be looking more at how you built it than at what you built.
